Lock-Out/Tag-Out (LOTO) is an essential safety procedure that protects employees who are exposed to hazardous energy during servicing/maintenance activities. Lock-Out involves applying a physical lock to all power sources on the equipment after they have been shut off and de-energized. Power sources can be mechanical, electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic. The source is then Tagged-Out with an easy-to-read tag that alerts other workers in the area that a lock has been applied. A hazardous energy control program is a critical part of an overall safety strategy and should include: ■Annual training and audits ■Machine Speciﬁ c LOTO procedures as part of the manual (see general checklist) ■Corporate policy Some minor servicing operations like minor tool changes or adjustments may have to be performed during normal production operations, and an employer may be exempt from LOTO in some instances.

The second step is then that of reducing the risk of any hazard which may still arise. This can be attained by protective measures, which are now generally implemented by the control system. In order for these protective measures (also described in their engineered implementation as protective devices) to attain a defined quality in consideration of the risk, an essential step is that of risk assessment. The protective device then serves as a safety-related part of a control system and as such executes the safety function in full or at least in part. It may for example prevent unexpected start-up when an operator enters a hazardous area. Since several safety functions can easily be present on a machine (for example for automatic and setup modes), it is important that careful consideration is given to each individual hazard and the associated safety function."
